# NOTES: Wish the following things worked:
#
# - Attempt to use xtclsh directly or using #! in scripts did not work
#   Not sure how to load vivado libraries in xtclsh automatically
#
# - So, have to invoke 'vivado -mode batch' which is slow and also requires
#   x11 libraries, even though you may not want to use the gui. Also it does
#   not work in #! way
#
# - So all we can do is to pass tcl scripts to vivado (1 or more) using this
#   command. There is no notion of search path, so please qualify the tcl
#   script names fully

exec vivado -mode batch -source $*
